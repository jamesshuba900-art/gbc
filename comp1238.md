## Week 1 – History of Text and Writing
- Writing began around 3000 BC in Mesopotamia using clay tablets (cuneiform).
- The Babylonian number system used base-60, which is why we still use 60 minutes and 60 seconds.
- A writing system can represent different languages (example: Behistun inscription).
## Week 2 – Representing Text and Numbers in Computers
- Computers store everything using bits (0 and 1), and 8 bits make 1 byte.
- RAM is volatile memory (data disappears when power is off), while storage like SSD or HDD is non-volatile.
- 1 KB can mean 1000 bytes or 1024 bytes depending on context.
- ASCII assigns numbers to characters (example: 'A' = 65).
## Week 3 – Structure of Text
- Text files are organized into lines, and line breaks are represented by special control characters (like newline).
- Whitespace and indentation help show structure and make text easier to read.
- Markdown and HTML are markup languages used to structure and format text.
- Special characters (like # or < >) sometimes need to be escaped to be shown literally.
## Week 4 – Manipulating Text & Text Editors
- Text editors (like VS Code) are used for writing plain text and code, unlike word processors like Microsoft Word.
- Touch typing helps reduce cognitive load and makes coding more efficient.
- VS Code is one of the most popular editors and supports extensions and version control.
- Searching tools like Ctrl+F, wildcards, and basic regex help find and modify text quickly.
## Week 5 – Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
- The CLI allows you to interact with the computer by typing commands and receiving text responses.
- SSH is used to securely connect to remote computers.
- Basic commands like ls, cd, pwd, and cat are used to navigate and read files.
- Piping (|) and redirection (>, >>) allow combining commands and saving output to files.
